# Alumni-Map
Phase 1: Basic Map Implementation (Leaflet.js)
  Set up a Leaflet.js map centered on a default location.
  Integrate zoom in/out functionality (zoom out to the world level).
  Fetch and display alumni location data with red markers.
  Implement interactive popups on markers to show alumni details.


Phase 2: Transition to 3D Globe (Three.js Integration)
  Implement a seamless transition from Leaflet map to a Three.js globe at max zoom-out.
  Render the globe with alumni locations mapped onto it.
  Ensure smooth camera controls for interaction (rotation, zoom, tilt).


Phase 3: Enhanced Alumni Popups & Data Integration
  Ensure popups work on both 2D map and 3D globe views.
  Style popups for clarity and usability.
  Fetch alumni details dynamically from a database or API.
